Description: This package implements the large inverse covariance estimation for local
stationary processes using method introduced in Dallakyan and Pourahmadi 2019. In
particular, using the standard Cholesky factor as the new parameters, we propose Smoothed
Cholesky (SC) algorithm to estimate the covariance (inverse) matrix. It is a block coordinate
descent algorithm which subdiagonally smoothes the Cholesky factor using fused lasso type
penalties.
